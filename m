The performance cost of that would be very high, so it would only have
any chance at possibly being reasonable for some of the asymmetric
algorithms.  It would also introduce reliability issues.

I'll also note that the main reason that people seem to want private key
operations in the kernel is for the keyctl() UAPIs for userspace, which
is already a bad idea.  So I guess we end up with userspace calling into
the kernel, which calls back into userspace to use some userspace crypto
library which the original userspace program refused to use in the first
place for some reason?  It makes no sense to me, sorry.

There is the opportunity to share more code with userspace projects at
the source code level.  Just it doesn't always work out due to different
languages, licences, requirements, conventions, and implementation
qualities.  For ML-DSA verification I didn't see a good alternative to
just writing it myself.  But in other cases a different conclusion could
be reached.  The kernel uses a lot of the assembly files from
CRYPTOGAMS, for example, and some of the Curve25519 code (including
formally verified code) is imported from other sources.
