You mean IMA should not sign the digest in the ima_file_id structure but 
hash the ima_file_id structure in which this file digest is written into 
(that we currently sign) and sign/verify this digest? And we would do 
this to avoid two different files (with presumably different content) 
from having the same hashes leading to the same signature? Which hashes 
(besides the non-recommended ones) are so weak now that you must not 
merely sign a file's hash?

The problem with this is that older kernels (without patching) won't be 
able to handle newer signatures.

And I was sure whether it was merely an 'option'. Who would use it then 
if it takes more cycles to hash the prepended 11 byte oid in HashML-DSA?
