I hadn't been thinking of this... It's a side-effect of starting to sign 
ima_file_id for v3 that a file *content* could now hold the ima_file_id 
structure (as signed with v3) and the signature would validate when used 
with the v2 signature verification scheme. So, the content of the file 
would presumably be odd/useless (2 bytes + hash) but it would verify 
with the signature created for v3. We will have to offer the possibility 
to move to v3 signatures for all signing schemes and offer the 
possibility to deactivate older versions (<v3).
