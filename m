My idea was to have an `const DEFAULT: Option<Self>` to represent the
following:
(1) if `DEFAULT =3D=3D None`, then `KERNEL_PARAM_OPS_FL_NOARG` is not set
    and thus either the `module!` user-specified default value is used,
    or it is specified via `my_module.param=3Dvalue` and
    `try_from_param_arg` is called.
(2) if `DEFAULT =3D=3D Some(d)`, then `KERNEL_PARAM_OPS_FL_NOARG` is set an=
d
    when `NULL` is given to `kernel_param_ops.set`, the parameter value
    is set to `d`, otherwise `try_from_param_arg` is called.

But I think I agree with you removing `NOARG_ALLOWED`, see below.

I am not sure that putting the default value of `my_module.param` into
the `ModuleParam` trait is a good idea. It feels more correct to me to
add an optional field to the part in `module!` that can be set to denote
this default value -- we might also want to change the name of
`default`, what do you think of `default_inactive` and `default_active`?

Since one might want an option by default be `true` and when one writes
`my_module.param`, it should be `false`.
Also as the C side shows, having default values for integer types is not
really a good idea, since you might want a non-zero default value.
If one does not specify the `default_active` value, then the
`KERNEL_PARAM_OPS_FL_NOARG` is not set.

If you don't want to implement this (which I can fully understand, since
we might get `syn` before anyone needs params with default values), then
we should write this idea down (maybe in an issue?). But regardless, I
would like to know your opinion on this topic.

But what drops the default value, when an actual value is specified via
`my_module.param=3Dvalue`? (or is the default value only assigned when
nothing is specified?)

Yes.

This just shows to me that a "global" default in `ModuleParam` is wrong,
since for `use_cmb_sqes` one could either have a negated flag, or no
default value, forcing the user to write `nvme.use_cmb_sqes=3Dfalse`.

I think eventually this will be useful, but as you said it's not a
feature that you *need*.

That *might* be fine, but I don't know if there is anything that would
guarantee you that it is. Note that the code above uses a shared
reference, which definitely isn't OK.
