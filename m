Subject: [PATCH v2 1/3] Use SPDX header for license
Date: Tue, 23 Jul 2024 13:59:19 -0500

Precedence: bulk
X-Mailing-List: linux-modules@vger.kernel.org
List-Id: <linux-modules.vger.kernel.org>
List-Subscribe: <mailto:linux-modules+subscribe@vger.kernel.org>
List-Unsubscribe: <mailto:linux-modules+unsubscribe@vger.kernel.org>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Drop the lengthy license from each file and just use SPDX like most
projects nowadays. This doesn't have any change to license, just how
they are recorded in each file.

This follows the kernel approach: header files use '/*' for comments
while .c files use '//'.
