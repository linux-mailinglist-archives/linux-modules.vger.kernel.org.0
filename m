It also increases the reference count, and creates a user/kernel api
with the symlinks, right?  Will the reference count increase prevent the
modules from now being unloadable?

This feels like a very "weak" link between modules that should not be
needed if reference counting is implemented properly (so that things are
cleaned up in the correct order.)

Please don't paper over the real issue with this hack.
