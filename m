Hi Petr,

Yes. STG is fairly large and written in C++, so it didn't seem like a
great candidate for inclusion in the kernel tree, and it's presumably
not shipped by most distributions, so it's not really ideal as a
dependency either.

What I meant is that genksyms output is basically preprocessed C with
references scattered in, so if you want something that's fully
backwards compatible, that might not be possible. However, if you're
happy with just the same database structure and don't care about the
exact type description format beyond that, that should be doable, but
like you said, still requires extending the format to support more
complex type names.

I do see your point, there's a ton of duplication in the --debug
output as each symbol expands all the types it uses.

I agree, there might be other DWARF changes that we don't care about,
but that nevertheless make it harder to figure out what caused the
actual CRC to change.

My initial thought was that simply running a diff between the --debug
output would be sufficient, as it would directly tell you what
changed, but I didn't consider that the size of the output dump would
be of concern as well. I'll look into adding a symtypes-style output
format in the next version. Thanks again for the feedback!

Sami
