Hello all,

     About a yer or so ago, I upgraded one of my Debian servers to 
Bullseye, and it killed the 10G NIC on the server due to issues with the 
device driver in the Debian repository.  I jumped through all sorts of 
loops and hoops to try to get it working, but I finally had to give up 
and resort to using the 1G interface. Recently, I tried upgrading 
another server to the new Debian Bookworm, and it worked for that 
server, so apparently the issue has been fixed in Bookworm.

     With that in mind, I went ahead and upgraded the original server to 
Bookworm, but the NIC remains dead.  Unfortunately, I cannot find ny 
notes on what I did originally to try to get the 10G interface working 
and to shut it down in favor of a built-in port.  I do recall I tried 
compiling what was supposed to be the correct firmware driver and also 
changing the udev rules, but I do not recall the exact details.  I have 
tried several things, including re-installing the firmware, but nothing 
seems to work. The Ethernet interface does not appear on the system in 
order to be able to specify it in /etc/network/interfaces.  What can I 
do in order to try to get the 10G card working?

     The card is an Asus MCB-10G_PEB-10G NIC and uses the bnx2x.ko 
driver. The system uses an Asus AMD-64 motherboard.
