OK, then the commit log should describe that this doesn't fix any known
real world issue, but rather a custom crafted module without the regular
module build system.

That should be clearly stated on the commit log.

Consider that a next level university assignment and is more useful to the world
than this debug message. Because above you suggest "I don't think", go
out and now be sure.

Who would create custom modules without the Linux kernel module build
system, and what uses does that provide? It seems you are proving why
this would be terribly silly thing to do.

Now, the *value* your change has is it can prevent a crash in case of a
corrupted module, which *can* occur, consider an odd filesystem
live corruption, at least this would be caught at module load attempt
and not crash. That's worth committing for this reason but your commit
log really needs much more clarity. Why? Because stupid bots want to
assign stupid CVEs for anything that seems like a security issue and
this could escalate to such type of things. Providing clarity helps
system integrators decide if they want to backport this sort of patch.
Providing clarify on the chances of this happening and how we think it
can happen helps a lot.

If you want to be more proactive, try to enhance userspace kmod modprobe
so that this is also verified.
