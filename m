I see. I suggested to Andreas to change it to the current version, seems
like I was wrong on this... I feel like the `SyncUnsafeCell` version is
still better, since we can avoid a `static mut`.

That would also be an option, but it might be confusing for people, they
enter a SCREAMING_CASE_SNAKE name, but when they start the kernel it
doesn't work.

Yeah I expressed this poorly, the problem before was that you would
write:

    module! {
        /* ... */
        params: {
            foo: i64 {
                default: 1,
                description: "foo",
            }
        }
    }

    pub struct MyDriver {
        foo: i64,
    }

    impl Module for MyDriver {
        fn init(_: &'static ThisModule) -> Result<Self> {
            let foo =3D foo.read();
            //  ^^^ cannot be named the same as a static
            Ok(Self { foo })
        }
    }

Yes that's what I meant, although `my_param` should be `pub(crate)`.

Yeah, but I think since they are in their own module, it's fine.

One thing that we need to decide would be if we want

    mod_params::my_param::read()

or

    mod_params::my_param.read()

I slightly prefer the first one, which would mean that the expansion
would have to be:

    mod mod_params {
        pub(crate) enum my_param {}
        static my_param_value: ModParam<i32> =3D ModParam::new(...);
        impl my_param {
            pub(crate) fn read() {
                my_param_value.read()
            }
            /* ... */
        }
    }

Good to know!
