There's no differentiation between a 'struct ima_file_id' that
*represents* the contents of some file, and a file whose contents are
*equal to* that 'struct ima_file_id' and that uses a full-file hash.  In
both cases the same key and message are used for signing and verifying.

This means that every time a file is signed using the ima_file_id
scheme, it also implicitly signs some other file contents, which an
attacker can freely replace the file with.  Similarly, every time a file
that happens to be a valid ima_file_id is signed using the older scheme,
it also implicitly signs the contents that the ima_file_id correspond
to, which the attacker can freely replace the file with.  In either
case, no collision in the cryptographic hash function is required.

It's simply a broken protocol.  To fix this, IMA must only support
signatures that use the ima_file_id scheme.

Of course, that will require making them support full-file hashes and
not just fsverity hashes.  If I recall correctly, this was actually part
of the original design of the ima_file_id-based signatures.  It's
unclear why the implementation is still incomplete.
