Hi Petr,

Sorry, I haven't had a chance to actually test this out but I see this 
problem with the acpi_cpufreq and other multiple-cpu drivers which load 
once per logical cpu.  I was thinking of adding a udev rule like:

ACTION!="add", GOTO="acpi_cpufreq_end"

# I may have to add CPU modaliases here to get this to work correctly
ENV{MODALIAS}=="acpi:ACPI0007:", GOTO="acpi_cpufreq_start"

GOTO="acpi_cpufreq_start"
GOTO="acpi_cpufreq_end"

LABEL="acpi_cpufreq_start"

ENV{DELAY_MODALIAS}="$env{MODALIAS}"
ENV{MODALIAS}=""
PROGRAM="/bin/sh -c flock -n /tmp/delay_acpi_cpufreq sleep 2'", 
RESULT=="", RUN{builtin}+="kmod load $env{DELAY_MODALIAS}"

LABEL="acpi_cpufreq_end"

Yes, that would be the case.

That's an interesting idea and something I had not considered.  Creating 
a virtual device and loading against that device would be much better 
(easier?) of a solution.
