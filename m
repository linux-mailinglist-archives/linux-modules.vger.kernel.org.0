Hmm what parameters actually are optional? I looked at the old rust
branch and only `bool` is marked as optional. Are there others?

If it is used commonly for custom parameters (I could imagine that Rust
modules have enums as parameters and specifying nothing could mean the
default value), then it might be a good idea to just include it now.
(otherwise we might forget the design later)

Hmm I think that might be a bit unexpected, since everywhere else in
Rust you are allowed to omit the trailing comma. But I guess if the
entire `module!` macro does that currently, then we can change that when
we move to `syn`.

Hmm, why is it not `paramtype`? Does that conflict with something?

When compiling this [1] with a sufficiently new Rust version, you will
get an error:

So I think we should start using `addr_of!` for mutable static now.

All the more reason to use `addr_of!` IMO.

Yeah, I would prefer if we can avoid having both a constant and a type.
The type then also can be an empty enum, so no value can be constructed.

I don't know that, maybe Gary or someone else knows how this works.

Not really, I don't think that this is a big deal, since this will
eventually be replaced by `syn`, which can be formatted more easily.
