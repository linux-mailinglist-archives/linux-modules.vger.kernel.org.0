I don't believe the fix you desire is as critical as you think it is.

Majority of people do not compile and install bleeding edge kernels,
on an EOL release with a 5 year old kmod, when both are released by
the same upstream project (more or less).
Also your fix will prevent people to use EOL release for kernel
compilation (or introduce requirement to have kmod installed on the
build host), when they do not execute install on the same system (but
transfer the files into a packaging format / execute depmod using up
to date kmod not in path). Thus you may actually break even more
people with this change, as kmod versions have never been enforced
before.

I am still waiting for a response from you:
1) why you attempted this given non-default configuration build -
given your obsolete kmod in the installation target system
(intentionally attempting to choose config options to suitable for
your target)
2) why you want people to prevent compiling such a build, which they
can install later on with a compatible kmod (when their build-time and
install-time systems are different)

Which you have ignored responding to, in the previous emails.

I am trying to politely help you, and yet the tone of your emails are
very aggressive and very dismissive to me.

So far, this patch is a NACK from me.
