Thanks for a very nicely written and detailed summary.  Alas, I knew
all that already.

It's obviously true that the described problem with Panfrost and Lima
can be solved using weakdeps.  However, solving a problem and going
the extra mile to future-proof the solution are two rather different
things.  The proposed introduction of harddeps tries to go the extra
mile, and to future-proof any possible changes to weakdeps, as already
described in the patch description.

To sum it up, harddeps would be something like "pinned down" weakdeps,
that must not be removed by any future size-related optimizations of
the initial ramdisk contents.  While it costs us nearly nothing to add
support for that now, it may provide reasonable returns in the future.
And can be easily reverted at any point, if the later conclusion is
that the expected returns didn't pan out.

As an example of the differences between just solving a problem and
going the extra mile, let's have a look at the commit d5178578bcd4
(btrfs: directly call into crypto framework for checksumming) and the
lines containing MODULE_SOFTDEP at the very end of fs/btrfs/super.c. [3]
Are all those softdeps candidates for straight conversion into weakdeps,
i.e. can the kernel load all those modules by itself?  Perhaps, but
also maybe not, meaning that all those softdeps need to be investigated
and tested before the conversion, incurring additional cost.  OTOH, if
Btrfs went the extra mile and used some "syntactic sugar" instead, we'd
probably have the conversion ready to go now, at zero cost.

That's what the proposed "syntactic sugar" harddeps try to do, to save
us some time and effort later down the road.
