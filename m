That's good!

This is odd, why is it messing with LTO stuff?  It should be much more
"self contained" than this I feel like.

I see what you are doing by trying to use some of the LTO macros again,
but in doing so, it makes it really hard to understand the diff and feel
comfortable with this.

If you want to stick with what you have done here, can you split it up a
bit more?  Once patch for the LTO header file changes and then another
that only adds the staging stuff.  That way it's easier to review and
justify that nothing is going to be broken with this patch.

Yeah, checkpatch and macros can get tricky, use your best judgement here
and it looks ok.

I think it really fixes the commit _after_ this one that turns on the
taint for the build :)

anyway, nice work, I think it's almost there!
