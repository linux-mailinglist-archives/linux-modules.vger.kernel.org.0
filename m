Why are ahci devices somehow "special" here?  Just add a trigger to the
ahci core for LEDs and all should "just work".  We've done that for many
subsystems already.

Are you sure we don't already have LED triggers for disk activity?  Have
you tried the ledtrig-disk.c driver?  It says it works on ATA devices,
no reason it can't also work for other device types.

That's not fair, there is no way anyone can promise anyone that their
patches will be accepted, _before_ anyone sees them.  What would _you_
do if you were in the kernel maintainer's position and read something
like this?

good luck!
