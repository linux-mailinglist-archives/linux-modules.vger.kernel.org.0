Put in the time-dimension and you can figure out where this isn't inconsistent.

I can not tell anything else than I wrote above so I probably can't gain your 
trust that it was an honest mistake.

Thing is we are working on rewriting the driver bit by bit directly for upstream 
under GPL v2, e.g. 
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20241001180658.76396-2-wse@tuxedocomputers.com/

And we don't stop anyone else from doing so and actively involve ourself in the 
process, giving advice where we can from our experience with the devices, e.g. 
https://github.com/Wer-Wolf/uniwill-laptop/issues/1

And tuxedo-drivers got code in the past from external contributors under GPL v3 
that also weren't aware of the correct definition of MODULE_LICENSE("GPL") which 
needs to be sorted out.

And no tuxedo-drivers module would get accepted upstream as is at the moment, 
because the focus of the driver package is mainly to get support for new devices 
out as quickly as possible, while upstream rightfully has way stricter 
guidelines on code quality (not implying that tuxedo-drivers has bad code 
quality, it's a spectrum after all).

What I want to say: If the end goal is upstream support for our devices nothing 
is speed up by the relicensing, arguably it's slowed down because someone now 
has to sort out legal stuff. If you want to take on the actual coding work 
yourself, please do so, I will give you advice as I did with Armins uniwill 
laptop driver and several times on the mailing list.

Kind regards,

Werner Sembach
