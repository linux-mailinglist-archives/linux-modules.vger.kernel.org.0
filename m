Works for me, but this is not a too trivial change, as the new 
try_module_get() function will require two parameters, instead of one:

	- the module to be referenced;
	- the module which will reference it.

On trivial cases, one will be THIS_MODULE, but, in the specific case
of snd_hda, the binding is done via an ancillary routine under 
snd_hda_core, but the actual binding happens at snd_hda_intel.

Ok, we could add a __try_module_get() (or whatever other name that
would properly express what it does) with two parameters, and then
define try_module_get() as:

	#define try_module_get(mod) __try_module_get(mod, THIS_MODULE)

Would that work for you?

Mauro
