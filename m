The thing about PLTs is that it's something I've never had the need to
make use of - because I've never been in the situation where the
arm32 module space has been close to overflowing. The addition of PLT
support for 32-bit arm did make my eyebrows raise for this very reason,
but I guess there are a small number of people who want to use really
large modules.

As such, I couldn't say whether it's broken or not - but it seems
sensible to keep both the 64-bit and 32-bit code tracking each other.
