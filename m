Hi Shivank,
thanks a lot for the comments and findings, I've fixed build and plan to update the patch set soon.

Regarding the benchmarks, we used self-implemented test with system calls load for now.
We used RedHawk Linux approach as a reference.

The "An Overview of Kernel Text Page Replication in RedHawk™ Linux® 6.3" article was used.
https://concurrent-rt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kernel-page-replication.pdf

The test is very simple:
All measured system calls have been invoked using syscall wrapper from glibc, e.g.

#include <sys/syscall.h>      /* Definition of SYS_* constants */
#include <unistd.h>
 
long syscall(long number, ...);

fork/1
    Time measurements include only one time of invoking this system call. Measurements are made between entering
    and exiting the system call.
fork/1024
    The system call is invoked in  a loop 1024 times. The time between entering a loop and exiting it was measured.
mmap/munmap
    A set of 1024 pages (if PAGE_SIZE is not defined it is equal to 4096) was mapped using mmap syscall
    and unmapped using munmap one. Every page is mapped/unmapped per a loop iteration.
mmap/lock
    The same as above, but in this case flag MAP_LOCKED was added.
open/close
    The /dev/null pseudo-file was opened and closed in a loop 1024 times. It was opened and closed once per iteration.
mount
    The pseudo-filesystem procFS was mounted to a temporary directory inside /tmp only one time.
    The time between entering and exiting the system call was measured.
kill
    A signal handler for SIGUSR1 was setup. Signal was sent to a child process, which was created using fork glibc's wrapper.
    Time between sending and receiving SIGUSR1 signal was measured.

Testing environment:
    Processor Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2690
    2 nodes with 12 CPU cores for each one.

Best Regards,
Artem
