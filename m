The main thing here is to reduce on-disk size, which I don't think
this will achieve.

I'd rather have the driver say it can support v1, v2, v3 fw and dracut
just put v3 in the initramfs if it's available, else put v2 in etc.

Obviously for newer hw support people will have to ship new fw
versions, and if something gets deprecated then we'd have to move the
fw for that to an always include list.

I envisaged something like

MODULE_FIRMWARE_GROUP("g1")
MODULE_FIRMWARE("fwv1.bin")
MODULE_FIRMWARE("fwv2.bin")
MODULE_FIRMWARE_GROUP_END("g2")

or

MODULE_FIRMWARE("fwv1.bin#g1")
MODULE_FIRMWARE("fwv2.bin#g2")

I also don't want to encourage any firmware teams from abandoning the
stable API principles I think this is mostly to deal with
hostile/semi-hostile and non-vendor drivers where we have no control.

It would be nice though for the couple of amdgpu hiccups we've had over tim=
e.
