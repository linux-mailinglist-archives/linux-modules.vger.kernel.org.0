Whee. That's from early 2013, more than 9 years ago.

Hmm.

You make a good argument:

This does seem to imply that limiting it to PF_USED_ASYNC is largely
pointless, at least for the originally stated reason of deadlocks with
other module loading.

However, we've done this for *so* long that I wonder if there might be
situations that have ended up depending on the lack of synchronization
for pure performance reasons.

If *this* module loading process started the async work, then we'd
wait for it, but what if there's other async work that was started by
others? This revert would now make us wait for that async work too,
and that might be a big deal slowing things down at boot time.

Looking at it, this is all under the 'module_mutex', so I guess we are
already single-threaded at least wrt loading other modules, so the
amount of unrelated async work going on is presumably fairly low and
that isn't an issue.

Anyway, I think this patch is the right thing to do, but just the fact
that we've avoided that async wait for so long makes me a bit nervous
about fallout from the revert.

Comments? Maybe this is a "just apply it, see if somebody screams" situation?
