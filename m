I found the original thread surrounding these changes and I do not think 
this solution should have been committed to the kernel.  It is not a 
good solution to the problem being solved and adds complexity where none 
is needed IMO.

The way to solve this is not in the module loading code, but in the udev 
code by adding a new event or in the userspace which handles the loading 
events.

Option 1)

Write/modify a udev rule to to use a flock userspace file lock to 
prevent repeated loading.  The problem with this is that it is still 
racy and still consumes CPU time repeated load the ELF header and, 
depending on the system (ie a large number of cpus) would still cause a 
boot delay.  This would be better than what we have and is worth looking 
at as a simple solution.  I'd like to see boot times with this change, 
and I'll try to come up with a measurement on a large CPU system.

Option 2)

Create a new udev action, "add_once" to indicate to userspace that the 
module only needs to be loaded one time, and to ignore further load 
requests.  This is a bit tricky as both kernel space and userspace would 
have be modified.  The udev rule would end up looking very similar to 
what we now.

The benefit of option 2 is that driver writers themselves can choose 
which drivers should issue "add_once" instead of add.  Drivers that are 
known to run on all devices at once would call "add_once" to only issue 
a single load.

Thoughts?
