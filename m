You _would_ be able to set the `default_inactive` value, which is the
value assigned to the static at initialization time. It would make sense
to default this to 0 for integer types and make it overridable in the
`module!` macro.

You would not be to set the `default_active` value, which is the value
assigned to the parameter static variable, when the parameter is passed
without value. The reason being that we want to mirror C, so we prohibit
this for predefined integer parameter types.

The way parameter parsing works in C (that we try to replicate) is that
we are able to parse a set of predefined types. For each predefined type
we have a set of parser functions. If a module author want to parse
something outside of the predefined set, they can provide custom parser
functions.

I would advocate we do the same in Rust. This patch provides a set of
predefined types that can be parsed. For parsing to other types, we
would eventually expand the features to allow the module authors to
implement the parsing trait on their own types.

So to answer your question: No, not in this patch set. But let's plan to
add it in the future.

In C, you cannot, if you utilize the predefined parameter parsing
functions. Your can supply your own parser, and then you can do whatever
you want.

I would assume that it is best practice to reuse the predefined parsing
functions. For Rust code I would argue that we should have module
authors use the predefined parsers, unless they have very special
requirements.

I think so.

As far as I can tell, the predefined C parsers only allow this for bool.
Outside of the predefined parsers, I see only 4 custom argument parsers
that allow parameters without values.

If we provide a predefined set of parsing functions, most uses will use
those, and we will get a similar user experience across most of the
modules. If we allow said customization of the predefined parsers,
people will use it those customizations, and we will not get a good user
experience. If we omit the customizations, I think most will still stick
to predefined semantics, rather than implement their own parsers. For
those that actually need to have other semantics (or types), we will
have the option of user provided parsers, just as C.
