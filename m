I do appreciate your detailed explanations, but please note that the
way softdeps and weakdeps work is already fully understood.

Please, read what I wrote in my earlier response, [1] which includes a
rather elaborate explanation of the intent behind MODULE_HARDDEP being
currently just a proposed alias for MODULE_WEAKDEP.  It also describes
why the "pinned softdeps", as I called the harddeps, are seen as 
important
in the long run, besides expressing the actual dependency better.
