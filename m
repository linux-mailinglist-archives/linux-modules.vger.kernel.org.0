I see that IMA indeed never upgraded full file hashes to use
'struct ima_file_id'.  Building a new feature that relies on this seems
like a bad idea though, given that it's a security bug that makes the
IMA protocol cryptographically ambiguous.  I.e., it means that in IMA,
when the contents of some file are signed, that signature is sometimes
also valid for some other file contents which the signer didn't intend.

Just fix that bug first, which has to be done anyway.  Then just use
pure ML-DSA to sign and verify the 'struct ima_file_id'.

As Simo mentioned, FIPS 204 doesn't require HashML-DSA when signing a
hash.  It's there as an *option* to solve a perceived problem, which is
actually solvable in better ways.

NIST doesn't plan to update FIPS 204 until 2029, and most likely the
updates will just be errata in the text (such as the ones I reported to
them), not changes or withdrawals in the algorithms themselves.  But
it's irrelevant: just because HashML-DSA is an option doesn't mean it
has to be used.  Pure ML-DSA supports arbitrary data, which includes
formatted hashes which allow for pre-hashing perfectly well.
