A related problem is platform (or hardware generation) specific firmware
blobs that are listed with MODULE_FIRMWARE, and thus added to the
generic initramfs. What if there was a way to limit them to the specific
platform you have? Sure, a generic initramfs would need them all, but
the vast majority of installs would only need the firmware for the
hardware on the system.

See 'ls /lib/firmware/i915/ | grep -o "^..." | sort | uniq'

I don't want to distract you from your original goal, but if you're
adding some grouping mechanism, maybe try to keep an avenue open for
grouping and filtering like that too?


BR,
Jani.
