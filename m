It's more complicated than that, as it would need to be a separate
trigger for each drive (ATA port).

I stumbled on that file myself last night.  I either wasn't aware of it
before, or I had forgotten its existence, possibly because it's disabled
(CONFIG_LEDS_TRIGGER_DISK=n).  As mentioned above, I would be looking to
enable "per port" LEDs, so it doesn't work in its current form.  It does
at least give me hope that enhancements might be accepted upstream.

You're right, but that isn't what I intended to say.  Basically, I can't
afford to invest the time in implementing something if the subsystem
maintainers have no interest in the *functionality*, regardless of the
state of the code.  I.e., if the ATA/LED subsystem maintainers think
that  software-controlled disk activity LEDs are stupid and have no
place in the kernel, then code quality is irrelevant, and anything I do
will be a waste of time.
