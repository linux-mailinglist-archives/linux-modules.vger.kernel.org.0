We should differentiate two situations here: The one is from Monday
when you realised that a non-GPL2 compatible kernel module is unable to
use many functions. The other (and IMHO more relevant) is when GPLv3 was
chosen knowing it's incompatible with the kernel's license. I would
argue that you were aware of that since at least March this year
(https://gitlab.com/tuxedocomputers/development/packages/tuxedo-drivers/-/i=
ssues/137#note_1807179414).

And in my opinion
https://gitlab.com/tuxedocomputers/development/packages/tuxedo-drivers/-/co=
mmit/a8c09b6c2ce6393fe39d8652d133af9f06cfb427
was a wrong reaction. I received this as a statement that your company's
goals are important enough to not adhere to the kernel's license and the
open source spirit. This was what triggered me to create the patch under
discussion.

I agree that it's unlucky that MODULE_LICENSE("GPL") doesn't apply for
GPLv3. Not sure if it's sensible to deprecate "GPL" and mandate "GPL v2"
though.

> Then I get called a liar

I guess you mean me here saying "That statement isn't consistent with
you saying to pick GPLv3 as an explicitly incompatible license to
control the mainlining process. So you knew that it's legally at least
questionable to combine these licenses."? If so: I understand that this
is discomfortable suggestion. However with my current understanding it's
true. If this is a problem with my understanding, please point out where
I'm wrong.

> and hit with the nuclear option not even full 3 days later,

For now we're in the discussion period for this "option". I would expect
that this patch doesn't go in before 6.12. So 6.13-rc1 should be the
earliest broken ("enforcing") kernel which probably starts to affect
your users starting with 6.13 final. The actual decision if and when to
apply this patch isn't mine though. But you should have at least a few
weeks to work on resolving the licensing.

> while I'm working on resolving the issue

This is good. You have my support to revert the patch under discussion
as soon as this is resolved.

I indeed wondered about your reaction.

I would wish that in people's mind open source licensing would be taken
as serious as for example fiscal laws. If my company was caught as tax
evader the officials would rather shut down the company's operation than
to allow another month with unclean bookkeeping.

So if you ask for my opinion, the right thing to do would be to stop
distributing tuxedo-drivers until this is resolved. Then I'd guess it's
your company's officials who would tell you about a time frame. But I'm
aware that I'm on the strong side of the spectrum of possibilities here.

Best regards
Uwe
