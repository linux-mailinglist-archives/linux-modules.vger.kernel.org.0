It isn't a fatal issue. So I wouldn't call it one. I would add a
message saying test timed out.

One way to handle this is:
- Add a test run-time option and have user tune it as needed.

Make the timeout an option so users can set it based on their
environments.

This test isn't part of the default run, so day has to run this as a
special case and it would make prefect sense to provide a tunable
timeout option.
