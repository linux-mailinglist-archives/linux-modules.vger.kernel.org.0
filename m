As far as I can tell from the C code, all parameters are able to have
the `NOARG` flag set. We get a null pointer in the callback in that
case.

If we want to handle this now, we could drop the `default` field
in the Rust module macro. There is no equivalent in the C macros.
And then use an `Option<Option<_>>` to represent the value. `None` would
be an unset parameter. `Some(None)` would be a parameter without a
value. `Some(Some(_))` would be a set parameter with a value. We could
probably fix the types so that only parameters with the `NOARG` flag use
the double option, others use a single option.

Or we could just not adopt this feature in the Rust abstractions.

Yes, I agree.

You would have to take that up with the maintainer(s) of the `modinfo`
tool. The name is externally dictated [1].

Oh. Thanks for the pointer.

Hmm, `addr_of_mut!` still requires the unsafe block. Hopefully that goes
away as well with the feature you linked as well.

This also requires `const_mut_refs`, but as I recall that is going to be
stabilized soon.
