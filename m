Thanks!

If Russell agrees the problem exists on 32bit arm, then I think it would be best to keep
these three together - going via the modules tree would make the most sense.

This has been broken for a while, so it can wait for v6.6-rc1.
I think the yocto folk plan to carry this out of tree until its in their chosen stable
version.


Thanks,

James
