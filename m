+1 to what Jason said.  The traditional API generally isn't going away.
However, there's no need to add new functionality to it when the library
is a better fit.  The crypto_sig abstraction doesn't seem very helpful,
since it was added only recently and has only one user (public_key).

The traditional crypto API's dynamic loading by name also tends to be
more harmful than helpful.  Linux users and distros keep running into
problems where algorithms aren't available in the initramfs when they
should be, or where the slow generic code is used instead of the
optimized code.  The direct linking finally just fixes that.

You may also still be thinking of the ML-DSA code as something
heavyweight.  I reduced it to under 4 KB of object code.

It should also become the recommended algorithm anyway, right?

Either way, 4 KB seems awfully small to be wanting to be dynamically
loaded.  Last year I shrunk the x86_64 AES-GCM code (which most Linux
distros build in to avoid the dynamic loading issues) by over 200 KB.
No one even seemed to care that much...  We can add a lot of stuff
before we're even back to where we were before that.
